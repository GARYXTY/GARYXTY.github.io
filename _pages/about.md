About Me
======
I have been a Ph.D. student at the Medical Robotics Lab, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences since Fall 2021. I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Zengguang Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~houzengguang) and Prof. [Xiaohu Zhou](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xhz). My research primarily focuses on human manipulation modeling and robotic skills learning. Specifically, I am exploring learning-based methods to model the brain-muscle modulation mechanism evident during human manipulation tasks. Using insights from this mechanism, I am working on designing brain-inspired robotic skill learning algorithms. Ultimately, my aim is to enable robots to achieve manipulation skills as dexterous as humans.

Before the Ph. D career, I received my B.S. degree with the highest honor - Academic Star (top 10 out of all UG students) from Tongji University (2017-2021), where I studied at School of Electronic and Information Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Zhuping Wang.
