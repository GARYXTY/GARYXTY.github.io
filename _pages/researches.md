Overall Goal
====

![这是一个示例图片](r0.png)

The overall goal of my research is to enable robots to achieve manipulation skills as dexterous as humans. To achieve this goal, we first start with human operational behaviors, exploring the brain's control mechanism over muscles during manipulation. Based on this, we will design robot skill learning algorithms, enabling robots to acquire human-like operational skills. Specifically, our research first aims to explain **how humans perform operations**, and then addresses **how robots can learn skills**.
