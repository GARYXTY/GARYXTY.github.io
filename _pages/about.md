About Me
======
I have been a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical Robotics Lab, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences since Fall 2021. I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Zengguang Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~houzengguang) and Prof. [Xiaohu Zhou](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xhz). My research primarily focuses on human manipulation modeling and robotic skills learning. Specifically, I am exploring learning-based methods to model the brain-muscle modulation mechanism evident during human manipulation tasks. Using insights from this mechanism, I am working on developing robotic learning algorithms with the ultimate goal of enabling robots to learn like humans and enhancing their operational capabilities—including improved success rates, broader generalization, and increased dexterity. ([Research Summary](https://garyxty.github.io/researches/)&[Publication List](https://garyxty.github.io/publications/))

Before my Ph.D. journey, I received my B.S. degree from Tongji University (2017-2021), graduating with the highest honor - Academic Star (ranking in the top 10 out of all undergraduate students). I pursued my studies at the School of Electronic and Information Engineering and had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. [Zhuping Wang](https://ivcm.tongji.edu.cn/info/1100/1178.htm). During my time there, I collaborated with Mr. Lingzhe Zhao on research related to monocular depth estimation and visual odometry for enhancing robotic visual perception. Additionally, I have collaborated with Dr. Chenzhao Feng from Tongji Medical College of HUST and Ms. Zixuan Yi from Wuhan University to conduct research on cancer subtype classification and prognosis analysis based on bioinformatics.


**I anticipate completing my Ph.D. in June 2026, and I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities. I am eager to build on my research experience to further advance in the fields, including cognitive robots, human-robot interaction, and brain-computer interface.**

**If there is anything to discuss or any potential collaboration opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me (E-mail: xiangtianyu2021@ia.ac.cn).**
